- 👋 Hi, I’m @ryan-di
- 👀 I’m interested in web dev & web frameworks (React in particular)
- 🌱 I’m currently 
  1. learning React from Kent C. Dodds 
  2. reading Redux source code
  3. preparing for coding interviews (LeetCode-cn is the main resource that I use)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on teaching & sharing tech!
